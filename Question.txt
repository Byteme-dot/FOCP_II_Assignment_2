# Assignment-Object Oriented Programming

Design and implement an object-oriented solution for a Student Management System 
that demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of C++ class concepts

=> Problem Statement 

A local university requires a software system to manage student information efficiently. The 
system should provide functionality to: 

• Create and manage student records 
• Track student academic information 
• Perform basic operations on student data

# System Requirements

1. Student Class Design

Develop a Student class with the following specifications:

• Private data members to store:  
	o Student name 
	o Roll number 
	o CGPA 
	o List of enrolled courses

• Constructors:  
	o Default constructor 
	o Parameterized constructor to initialize basic student details 
	o Copy constructor

2. Student Management Functionality

Implement methods in the Student class to: 

• Add new courses to a student's record 
• Update student CGPA 
• Display complete student information 
• Validate input data (e.g., CGPA range, course addition)


3. Student Management System Class 

Create a Student Management System class with capabilities to: 

• Add new students to the system 
• Search for students by roll number 
• Display all student records 
• Manage a collection of student objects 

=> Functional Requirements 

The system should support the following operations: 

1. Create student records with different initialization methods 
2. Add courses to a student's academic record 
3. Update academic performance (CGPA) 
4. Retrieve and display student information 
5. Perform basic error checking and input validation
